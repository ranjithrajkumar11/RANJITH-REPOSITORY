           <center> <h2>CHRIS GAYLE'S BLASTROUS 175</h2></center>
            <p>Chris Gayle played one of the most attacking Twenty 20 innings on 23rd April 2013 in the Indian Premier League. In a violent onslaught at Bangaloreâ€™s M Chinnaswamy Stadium, he romped to the highest T20 score of 175 against a hapless Pune Warriors team. The universal boss has scored 21 T20 hundred in his career till now and this one remained his fastest. He scored this only in 30 balls with 17 sixes and 13 fours.</p>

           <center><h2>BRENDON'S MEMORABLE FIRST INNINGS</h2></center>
           <p>It was the innings that changed cricket forever. On the competition's opening night, Brendon McCullum's breathtaking 158 not out confirmed that the IPL was not merely a showbiz concept but the future of the sport: futuristic gold helmets and cheerleaders brought the glitz, but the league could not flourish without a world-class on-field spectacle.</p>

            <p>Ravi Ashwin ran out Jos Buttler at the non-striker's end in the Rajasthan Royals' season opener against Kings XI Punjab in Jaipur, as the Englishman wandered out of his crease prior to Ashwin's delivery stride, assuming the Indian spinner was about to deliver the ball.Instead, the Kings XI spinner paused and waited for Buttler to leave his ground before whipping off the bails.

                Buttler, who was playing alongside former Australia captain Steve Smith in his IPL return for the Royals, was forced to depart.</p>

            <CENTER><h2>DOUBLE THRILLER ON SUNDAY NIGHT</h2></CENTER>
            <p>History was made in Dubai on Sunday night when two Super Overs were needed for the first time in an IPL match to identify a winner. In the end, Kings XI Punjab prevailed over defending champions Mumbai Indians.

                After Mumbai Indians posted 176 for 6 in their 20 overs, Kings XI Punjab managed an identical score of 176/6.
                
                In the first super over, Jasprit Bumrah restricted Kings XI to 5/2. Mohammad Shami then bowled an excellent over to stop Mumbai Indians at 5 runs.
                
                The second super over saw Mumbai Indians score 11/1 off Chris Jordan. Needing 12 to win, Chris Gayle and Mayank Agarwal smashed Trent Boult all around  the park to hand Kings XI Punjab victory.</p>

            <p>Virat Kohli and Gautam Gambhir shared a heated exchange between them during a match between Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) and Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) at the Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru during Indian Premier League (IPL) 2013. While Gambhir was the captain of Kolkata Knight Riders, Kohli was leading RCB in the game. The duo had an ugly spat when Kohli was sledged after being dismissed by L Balaji.</p>
